### 1.INTRODUCTION OF OUR DATASET
Vertical dual bearings rotating machinery, which is common in the industry, exists a bearing center inconsistent problem. This problem will lead to the worsening degree of wear and shortening service life of bearings. In some extreme cases, it could even lead to the tilt of the column, and the sudden fall of the column, finally resulting in injuries and deaths. To analyze this problem, a system-level destructive experiment was designed and carried out in Automatic Car Washing Equipment for CRH (a double-bearing rotary machine for cleaning the body of high-speed train). We describe the continuous changing process of bearings from normal (healthy) state to abnormal (fault) state in a discrete way by artificially changing the degree of concentricity deviation. Running data of every equipment state is collected using the Industrial Intelligent Gateway developed by us. Finally, the NGIRC-2019-AWE-Dual-Bearings-Industrial-Dataset is constructed. 

The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:

(1)The dataset contains five kinds of data, including vibration acceleration signal, electrical signal, temperature, swing and inclination, so that it could provide multi-dimensional sensor signals (multiple features) labeled dataset for researchers. 

(2)This destructive experiment mainly aims at the bearing center inconsistent problem of vertical dual bearings rotating machinery, and realizes the health perception task at the system level.
